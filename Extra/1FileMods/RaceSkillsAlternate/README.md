Version 3.0.

Please be aware that the results are additive - so a Goblin ranger (an example) will get two skill states for being a ranger in armsmaster (thus a maximum of Expert) AND an additional one skill state from being a goblin, which would normally give him a Normal level of armsmaster, but since they are additive, 2+1 = 3 and 3 equals Master. For the same reason a Goblin Ranger would be able to get GM in Alchemy. :-S

I wish for a way to simply have it be the higher one. :(

From what I have read on the forums, it was previously like that when I suggested the Racial Skills, but then Xfing asked for the additive method, and so Rodril reworked it. Xfing of course never used it / never published his racial skills modification. *sigh*

Enough ranting.

Changelog:

3.0 - Sorted out the Expert maximums for races-only that changed somewhere during Rodril's development. And it's probably my fuckup. 

2.0 - I did try to address some issues with the Racial skills. I finally forced myself to do it, now that Rodril revamped the table structure.  
Dwarves were given expert repair (lore-based) and expert item identify, since they only had master axe and expert bow.  
Since humans tend to be Jacks of all trades, and so they even are in the MM universe, and they had no Mastery or GM racially, I decided to simply give them a boost to all utility skills by +1. Quite a lot of people told me that they were hands-down the most underpowered in that little mod of mine. So now if there is an utility skill (like alchemy) that you can master class-wise, being a human will enable you to GM it. Good enough for you? :D  
That means normal meditation, perception, regeneration, disarming, dodging, unarmed, identify monster, armsmaster, stealing, alchemy, identify item, merchant, repair. When the +1 max expertise boost is gained through a class that can already have these skills, it becomes adaptability at its finest (i.e. the human-specific trait).  
Character Creation created zombies now get base regeneration at start. "Hold together, pal!" :D :D  
The tutorial on the Tracker has also been updated.
